## Project Title

AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System (FinTech Dashboard)

---

## Project Overview

This project is a FinTech-style AI fraud detection control room built using Python and Streamlit.  
It simulates real-world banking transaction monitoring where an AI model detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning trained on a credit card dataset.  
The system provides a live dashboard experience similar to banking fraud monitoring systems used in financial institutions.

---

## Key Features

- Safe transaction stream simulation  
- Fraud detection stream simulation  
- Real-time analytics dashboard  
- Fraud vs Safe visualization (Pie Chart)  
- Risk trend analysis (Line Chart)  
- Dark FinTech UI inspired by Stripe  
- Login authentication (admin system)  
- Fully automated simulation without manual input  
- Machine learning-powered fraud prediction  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Plotly  
- Joblib

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shariqua06/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   
2. **Install dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Download dataset:**

   *Go to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud (kaggle.com in Bing)
   *Download creditcard.csv
   *Place it inside a folder named data/ in the project root

4. **Train the model:**
   
   bash

    python model_training.py
   
_This will generate models/fraud_model.pkl locally.

5. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
6.Access the dashboard in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501)
